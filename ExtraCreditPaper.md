## Extra Credit Opportunity
This talk is about neural network, which is a type of machine learning model that can be used to classify data. The neural network has input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Clare first uses an example of Spotify in which different types of music produces different sonic variable input and there are many artists in Spotify, neural network can then be used to predict music genre. Weights are applied to vectors these weights are eventually updated to make the model better (model-fitting). Clareâ€™s lab attempts to use algorithms to predict road quality based on merely satellite images instead of having to actually drive to a remote road. Then she used the cancer cell image net as an example to illustrate how to decide what layer to freeze. If image data are not available in a sufficiently large number, a problem of overfitting would appear and this problem can be solved with layer freezing and only use the weights from the transfer learning model.
