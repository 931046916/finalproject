# Question 1
Continuous data is a numerical data that can take on a range of values, such as height, weight and length. The magnitude and difference between numbers are important. Ordinal data is numerical data with order or scale; what's important for them is only the order, not the difference between values. Examples include the order in which people accomplish something, satisfaction rate, education level, etc. Arithmetic calculations between ordinal data are meaningless. Nominal data are catagorical data like countries, gender, race, etc.   
|Ranking of weight|Daily Sugar Ingestion|Body Mass Catagory|
| ----------------|:-------------------:| ----------------:|
|        1        |       130.94        |      Obese       |
|        2        |        80.25        |    Overweight    |  
|        3        |        40.17        |      Normal      | 
|        4        |        10.36        |    Underweight   |

The table shows the weight ranking, amount of daily sugar ingestion in grams and suggested body mass catagory for 4 men who are 6-feet-tall. The ranking of weight is an ordinal data that sequences the subjects' weights in decreasing order, amount of daily sugar ingestion is the continuous data that can be taken on a range of values, body mass catagory is the catagorical data that put the people into 4 catagories. There's a hypothetical correlation between daily sugar ingestion and weight ranking (the more grams of sugar one takes in per day, the higher weight ranking this person is likely to receive).
